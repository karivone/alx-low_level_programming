# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
What is a search algorithm
What is a linear search
What is a binary search
What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

# More Info
You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:

O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n*m -> O(nm)
n square -> O(n^2)
sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
…

0. Linear search
Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

Prototype : int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
size is the number of elements in array
And value is the value to search for
Your function must return the first index where value is located
If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
Every time you compare a value in the array to the value you are searching, you have to print this value (see example below)
wilfried@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 0-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
int main(void)
  {
     int array[] = {
       10, 1, 42, 3, 4, 42, 6, 7, -1, 9
    };
      size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

  printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 3, linear_search(array, size, 3));
  printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 42, linear_search(array, size, 42));
  printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, linear_search(array, size, 999));
  return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
}

Value checked array[0] = [10]
Value checked array[1] = [1]
Value checked array[2] = [42]
Value checked array[3] = [3]
Found 3 at index: 3

Value checked array[0] = [10]
Value checked array[1] = [1]
Value checked array[2] = [42]
Found 42 at index: 2

Value checked array[0] = [10]
Value checked array[1] = [1]
Value checked array[2] = [42]
Value checked array[3] = [3]
Value checked array[4] = [4]
Value checked array[5] = [42]
Value checked array[6] = [6]
Value checked array[7] = [7]
Value checked array[8] = [-1]
Value checked array[9] = [9]
Found 999 at index: -1

1. Binary search
Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

Prototype : int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to search in
size is the number of elements in array
And value is the value to search for
Your function must return the index where value is located
You can assume that array will be sorted in ascending order
You can assume that value won’t appear more than once in array
If value is not present in array or if array is NULL, your function must return -1
You must print the array being searched every time it changes. (e.g. at the beginning and when you search a subarray) (See example)
wilfried@0x1E-search_algorithms$ cat 1-main.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "search_algos.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always EXIT_SUCCESS
 */
 int main(void)
 {
   int array[] = {
    0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    };
    size_t size = sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0]);

 printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 2, binary_search(array, size, 2));
 printf("Found %d at index: %d\n\n", 5, binary_search(array, 5, 5));
 printf("Found %d at index: %d\n", 999, binary_search(array, size, 999));
 return (EXIT_SUCCESS);
